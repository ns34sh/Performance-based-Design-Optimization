# Performance-based-Design-Optimization
Design of reinforced concrete structures is usually an iterative process where a number of trials have to be performed to arrive at the final design which satisfies all the requirements stipulated by the codes. As such, it is difficult to ensure that the final design obtained is the best possible alternative. Also, the iterative nature of the design process and the lack of a formal approach to find such better alternatives further discourage the designer from attempting to find the best possible solution to the problem. A suitable optimization algorithm can help the designer in achieving a solution which not only satisfies all the requirements mandated by the codes but also requires the least resources to do so. Hence, this work proposes the use of one such algorithm and evaluates its efficacy in carrying out the design of reinforced concrete structures.

In this work, the cost of the structure is considered as the criteria to find the optimum structure. That is, the goal of optimization is to minimize the cost of the structure while making sure that no code requirements (such as strength or serviceability requirements) or performance criteria are violated.

To implement the above mentioned methodology, MATLABâ€™s genetic algorithm is used as the optimization algorithm. To carry out the analysis and design of the structures, SAP2000 software has been adopted.
